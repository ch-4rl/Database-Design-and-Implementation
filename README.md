# Database-Design-and-Implementation
Worked with a team to analyse company documents and questions to identify necessary database fields and suggest additional attributes to improve system flexibility. Designed an Extended Entity Relationship Diagram (EERD), created a table schema, and mapped requirements to the EERD to ensure feasibility.
Individually, the database was implemented and populated with meaningful data and ten tested SQL queries were written to address business requirements and validate the database's functionality
