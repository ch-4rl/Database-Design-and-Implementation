# Database-Design-and-Implementation
Collaborated on analyzing company documents to identify database fields and suggest enhancements. Designed an EERD, created a table schema, and mapped requirements to ensure feasibility. Independently implemented and populated the database with data, and wrote ten SQL queries to address business needs and validate functionality.
